# Model card for resnet18.

This repository contains the `imagenet` pre-trained weights for the `resnet18` model used as 
encoder in the [segmentation-models-pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel-org/segmentation_models.pytorch) library.

### Example usage:

1. Install the library:

```bash
pip install segmentation-models-pytorch
```

2. Use the encoder in your code:

```python
import segmentation_models_pytorch as smp

model = smp.Unet("resnet18", encoder_weights="imagenet")
```

### References

- Github: https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch
- Docs: https://smp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- Original weights URL: https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-5c106cde.pth


Output:
{
    "extracted_code": "import segmentation_models_pytorch as smp\n\nmodel = smp.Unet(\"resnet18\", encoder_weights=\"imagenet\")"
}
